# React Redux Example

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.

# Old Style Windchill

This lets you calcualte the Wind Chill based off temp (c) and wind speed (kmh). The value returned is based off the ms2 system which Canada used up until the early 2000s.

## Example

At -15c with a wind speed of 19kmh, the windchill would be 1550 (uncomfortably cold).

At -15c with a wind speed of 30kmh, the windchill would be 1750 (risk of frostbite).

### Note

Windchill was always rounded to the nearest 50.
